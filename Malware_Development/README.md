# Malware Dev for Ethical Hackers

* Code written as I went through the book [Malware Development for Ethical Hackers by Zhassulan Zhussupov](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/malware-development-for-ethical-hackers-9781801810173).
* They have a repo with sample code [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Malware-Development-for-Ethical-Hackers).
    * I have tried to improve upon the code, where possible, as I have gone through the sample pieces.
